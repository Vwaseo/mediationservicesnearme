"@type": "Question","name": "How can I secure visitation rights in California?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Start by attempting direct negotiation with the custodial parent for a written visitation agreement. If unsuccessful, file a petition in court, presenting reasons why visitation would benefit your child. California courts generally prioritize frequent and ongoing contact with both parents for the child&#39;s best interests. Obtain a visitation order by filing court forms, paying a fee, and attending a hearing, demonstrating the reasonableness of your request. Factors considered include your relationship with the child, history of violence/substance abuse, criminal record (if any), etc. Initiate visitation gradually, starting with short, supervised visits if the child is unfamiliar. Courts may order a custody evaluation, with costs potentially covered by you. Adhere strictly to the visitation order, keeping record of denied visits; file for contempt if necessary. Explore modification of the order if broader rights become necessary over time."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How long does child support last in California?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Child support typically extends until the child reaches 18 years old, provided they graduate from high school. If graduation occurs after turning 18, support continues until graduation or age 19, whichever comes first. For a disabled child, unable to self-support, child support may persist indefinitely, given the disability originated before age 18. Various factors can influence the duration of support, including outstanding back payments, which may continue until fully paid, and court-ordered contributions for college expenses, potentially extending support beyond age 18."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What are the consequences of not paying child support in California?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Failure to pay child support in California can result in severe consequences, including being held in contempt of court, leading to potential fines or jail time. The court may order wage garnishment, intercept tax refunds, suspend driver&#39;s licenses, and place liens on property. Professionals like doctors and lawyers may face suspension of their licenses, and delinquent payments can be referred to collection agencies. Additionally, interest accrues on overdue amounts, and unpaid support is reported to credit bureaus, negatively impacting credit scores. In cases of repeat or intentional violations, civil or criminal contempt charges may be pursued, with jail time viewed as a last resort."

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Start by attempting direct negotiation with the custodial parent for a written visitation agreement. If unsuccessful, file a petition in court, presenting reasons why visitation would benefit your child. California courts generally prioritize frequent and ongoing contact with both parents for the child&#39;s best interests. Obtain a visitation order by filing court forms, paying a fee, and attending a hearing, demonstrating the reasonableness of your request. Factors considered include your relationship with the child, history of violence/substance abuse, criminal record (if any), etc. Initiate visitation gradually, starting with short, supervised visits if the child is unfamiliar. Courts may order a custody evaluation, with costs potentially covered by you. Adhere strictly to the visitation order, keeping record of denied visits; file for contempt if necessary. Explore modification of the order if broader rights become necessary over time.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Child support typically extends until the child reaches 18 years old, provided they graduate from high school. If graduation occurs after turning 18, support continues until graduation or age 19, whichever comes first. For a disabled child, unable to self-support, child support may persist indefinitely, given the disability originated before age 18. Various factors can influence the duration of support, including outstanding back payments, which may continue until fully paid, and court-ordered contributions for college expenses, potentially extending support beyond age 18.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Failure to pay child support in California can result in severe consequences, including being held in contempt of court, leading to potential fines or jail time. The court may order wage garnishment, intercept tax refunds, suspend driver&#39;s licenses, and place liens on property. Professionals like doctors and lawyers may face suspension of their licenses, and delinquent payments can be referred to collection agencies. Additionally, interest accrues on overdue amounts, and unpaid support is reported to credit bureaus, negatively impacting credit scores. In cases of repeat or intentional violations, civil or criminal contempt charges may be pursued, with jail time viewed as a last resort.</p>
