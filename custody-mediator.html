"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "Can mediation be used for issues other than divorce and custody?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "While mediation is commonly used for divorce and child custody cases, its benefits extend far beyond those contexts. Mediation can resolve many other personal, business, and legal disputes through collaborative conflict resolution. For example, mediation can create mutually acceptable agreements related to dividing property, establishing child or spousal support, modifying existing support orders, crafting visitation plans, obtaining restraining orders, and more. Mediators can also facilitate discussions to settle disputes between landlords and tenants, employers and employees, businesses and consumers, patients and insurance companies, and any other parties struggling to reach agreements. Trained mediators have the skills to handle sensitive conversations, identify interests, and generate win-win solutions. Parties often find mediation to be more empowering and satisfying than relying on courts or lawyers. It also saves time and money compared to litigation. As long as parties are willing to negotiate in good faith, mediation can successfully resolve conflicts and produce legally-binding agreements related to many civil, commercial, workplace, and family law matters outside of what courts can order. With its flexibility and emphasis on mutual understanding, mediation is effective for far more than just divorce and custody cases."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Can I file for mediation without going to court?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, you can file for mediation without going to court first. Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that allows parties to work out their differences with the assistance of a neutral third-party mediator. Unlike litigation, mediation is voluntary, confidential, and less adversarial. To start the mediation process, the parties must agree to mediate their dispute. One or both parties can initiate mediation by contacting mediation organizations or individual mediators and asking them to mediate. Many courts also have mediation programs and will allow parties to file a request for mediation. As long as both sides agree to mediate, you can file for mediation without ever stepping foot in a courtroom. The mediator will work with both parties to facilitate open communication, identify interests, and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable settlement. If mediation does not resolve the dispute, the parties can still pursue litigation later. But filing for mediation first is completely voluntary and does not require prior court action. Mediation can be a faster, cheaper, and more amicable way to settle many disputes out of court."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How is child support determined in California?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "In California, child support is calculated using a statewide formula that considers each parent&#39;s income and custody share. The goal is to maintain a consistent standard of living for the child in both households. For one child, the basic child support amount is typically around 20% of the paying parent&#39;s net income, with incremental increases for additional children. Courts may also factor in health insurance, childcare costs, and special needs of the child, making the final amount vary. Child support generally continues until the child turns 18, finishes high school, or, in the case of a child with a disability, may extend beyond age 18. If a parent deliberately avoids employment or is underemployed, the court can impute income to calculate child support based on potential earning capacity. Modifications can be requested if financial circumstances change, and failure to pay court-ordered child support can lead to consequences such as wage garnishment and license suspension."

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>While mediation is commonly used for divorce and child custody cases, its benefits extend far beyond those contexts. Mediation can resolve many other personal, business, and legal disputes through collaborative conflict resolution. For example, mediation can create mutually acceptable agreements related to dividing property, establishing child or spousal support, modifying existing support orders, crafting visitation plans, obtaining restraining orders, and more. Mediators can also facilitate discussions to settle disputes between landlords and tenants, employers and employees, businesses and consumers, patients and insurance companies, and any other parties struggling to reach agreements. Trained mediators have the skills to handle sensitive conversations, identify interests, and generate win-win solutions. Parties often find mediation to be more empowering and satisfying than relying on courts or lawyers. It also saves time and money compared to litigation. As long as parties are willing to negotiate in good faith, mediation can successfully resolve conflicts and produce legally-binding agreements related to many civil, commercial, workplace, and family law matters outside of what courts can order. With its flexibility and emphasis on mutual understanding, mediation is effective for far more than just divorce and custody cases.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, you can file for mediation without going to court first. Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that allows parties to work out their differences with the assistance of a neutral third-party mediator. Unlike litigation, mediation is voluntary, confidential, and less adversarial. To start the mediation process, the parties must agree to mediate their dispute. One or both parties can initiate mediation by contacting mediation organizations or individual mediators and asking them to mediate. Many courts also have mediation programs and will allow parties to file a request for mediation. As long as both sides agree to mediate, you can file for mediation without ever stepping foot in a courtroom. The mediator will work with both parties to facilitate open communication, identify interests, and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable settlement. If mediation does not resolve the dispute, the parties can still pursue litigation later. But filing for mediation first is completely voluntary and does not require prior court action. Mediation can be a faster, cheaper, and more amicable way to settle many disputes out of court.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>In California, child support is calculated using a statewide formula that considers each parent&#39;s income and custody share. The goal is to maintain a consistent standard of living for the child in both households. For one child, the basic child support amount is typically around 20% of the paying parent&#39;s net income, with incremental increases for additional children. Courts may also factor in health insurance, childcare costs, and special needs of the child, making the final amount vary. Child support generally continues until the child turns 18, finishes high school, or, in the case of a child with a disability, may extend beyond age 18. If a parent deliberately avoids employment or is underemployed, the court can impute income to calculate child support based on potential earning capacity. Modifications can be requested if financial circumstances change, and failure to pay court-ordered child support can lead to consequences such as wage garnishment and license suspension.</p>
